# Adjusting for adherence in randomized trials when adherence is measured as a continuous variable:

# The data for this analysis can be obtained by application to the NHLBI using the BIOLINCC portal at https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/studies/lrccppt/.
# We need to clean the data using the code in \code\data_cleaning.R

# The data cleaning step may take several minutes.

# Now we define the models which will be used to estimate the numerator and denominator
# of our stabilized inverse probability weights.
# Further details can be found in the manuscript's supplementary material.

# In order to obtain the point estimates, we fit the models described in the manuscript.

# The models may take several minutes to fit.

# We can now print the risk differences reported in the manuscript.
